# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description of the project:
My project showcases the **Washington Metropolitan Transit** route **33** using the Google Maps API, connecting the Cathedral of Washington and the White House. In this project, I've implemented live markers for buses in real-time along this route. Additionally, I've enhanced the user experience by adding images at the destination/origin points of the route, namely the Cathedral of Washington and the White House. My idea is to create a guide for people who want to travel between these two places by bus, helping them know when the bus is arriving and plan their journey more effectively.
To execute this code, you'll need to obtain your Google API key beforehand, as well as a key from any available free public transportation API, with its respective URL (refer to the [attached link](https://publicapis.io/category/transportation) for a comprehensive list of transportation APIs ). This information is crucial for someone looking to run the project on your machine. For detailed instructions on obtaining your Google API key, please follow the instructions provided in the [attached link](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-setup).

## How to Run:

Fork this repo and clone it to your local machine.

Open index.html in your VSCODE and write the Google Maps API key and the buses API keyâ€”please insert them into their respective designated spaces within the code before running it.

Save your work IN VSCODE and refresh your browser to check for ,ap n the website.

***very important***: Ensure that your data URL and key are functioning correctly, and validate that the data format is in an appropriate array type. Be certain to select the route number of the bus you wish to mark. In my case, I used route 33 from the transportation website of Washington ([link](https://developer.wmata.com/)).

## Roadmap of future improvements:
There are numerous additions and improvements to be made to this code. I desire additional features such as incorporating the bus stops for the route 33 bus, complete with popup informative messages that update in real-time, providing the name of the stop and the time of the next bus arrival. In terms of functionality, I aim to enhance the map's dynamism with UI elements, making it more appealing for the visitor's experience.
